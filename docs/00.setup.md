# Demo add funcion example project

## Reference

## Coding pattern preferences

- Always prefer simple solutions.
- Always follow software development principles ensuring the quality, maintainability, and longevity of the project. Here the relevant principles: the SOLID (Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Open/Closed Principle (OCP), Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP), Interface Segregation Principle (ISP), Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)), DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It), Convention over Configuration, Composition over Inheritance, and Law of Demeter.
- Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, which means checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
- Write code that takes into account the different environments: dev, test, and prod.
- You are careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested.
- When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation. And if you finally do this, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards so we don't have duplicate logic.  
- Keep the codebase very clean and organized.
- Avoid writing scripts in files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once.
- Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code. Refactor at that point.
- Mocking data is only needed for tests, never mock data for dev or prod.  
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the dev or prod environments.
- Never overwrite my .env file without first asking and confirming.

## Coding workflow preferences

- Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task.
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task.
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality.
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed.
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes.

## Setup

Here the instructions on how setup an "add funcion" example project from scratch.

Open a terminal and type:

```sh
npm init
```

with the following input:

```sh
(base) userone@MacBookAir goldbear-add % npm init
This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.
package name: (goldbear-add) 
version: (1.0.0) 
description: goldbear add function
entry point: (index.js) 
test command: 
git repository: 
keywords: 
author: Stan Goldbear

About to write to /Users/userone/wa/projects/JSProjects/goldbear-add/package.json:

{
  "name": "goldbear-add",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "goldbear add function",
  "main": "index.js",
  "directories": {
    "doc": "docs"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Stan Goldbear",
  "license": "MIT"
}


Is this OK? (yes) yes
```

thi is the `package.json` just created:

```json
{
  "name": "goldbear-add",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "goldbear add function",
  "main": "index.js",
  "directories": {
    "doc": "docs"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Stan Goldbear",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

then install dependencies with:

```sh
npm install --save-dev typescript ts-node
yarn add -D typescript ts-node
```

Setup `tsconfig.json`, run the following command

```sh
npx tsc --init
```

In `tsconfig.json` add the following changes:

```json
// ..
"outDir": "./dist",
// ..
```

Create your `src` folder and create your `index.ts` file:

```sh
mkdir src
touch src/index.ts
```

In `src/index.ts` paste in the code below,
it is a simple function to add 2 numbe:

```ts
export interface AddFunction {
    (a: number, b: number): number;
}

export const add: AddFunction = (a: number, b: number): number => {
    return a + b;
};

console.log(add(3, 5)); //output: 8
```

Run the code with the following command:

```sh
npx ts-node src/index
```

you should see the result of `8`.
Now remove delete the "console.log" line in `src/index.ts`:

```diff
- console.log(add(3, 5)); //output: 8
```

Now create a `.gitignore`:

```sh
/node_modules

# Ignore test-related files
/coverage.data
/coverage/

# Build files
/dist

# macos
.DS_Store
```

then create a `README.md` with how to install, usage example, features, etc.

## Building your Typescript package

How to build your package for the end users to be able to consume it in their various javascript or typescript projects. Setting up `Tsup`:

```sh
npm install tsup -D
touch yourtsup.config.ts
```

Create `tsup.config.ts` file and paste the code below:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "tsup";

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ["src/index.ts"],
  format: ["cjs", "esm"], // Build for commonJS and ESmodules
  dts: true, // Generate declaration file (.d.ts)
  splitting: false,
  sourcemap: true,
  clean: true,
});
```

Update the "scripts" in your `package.json` with the following:

```json
    "scripts": {
        "build": "tsup",
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
    },
```

Build your project by running:

```sh
npm run build
```

Update the main in your `package.json` and add the following:

```json
//..
  "main": "./dist/index.js",
  "module": "./dist/index.mjs",
  "types": "./dist/index.d.ts",
  "files": [
    "dist"
  ],
//..
```

## Testing NPM package

Add jest to your project by running the following command:

```sh
npm install -D jest ts-jest @types/jest
touch jest.config.js
```

Add the following into `jest.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  preset: "ts-jest",
  testEnvironment: "node",
};
```

Create a "tests" folder in your project, and adda test:

```sh
mkdir test
touch test/add.test.ts
```

in `test/add.test.ts` add the following:

```ts
import { add } from '../src';

describe('AddFunction', () => {
    const testCases: Array<[number, number, number]> = [
        [2, 3, 5],
        [-2, -3, -5],
        [-2, 3, 1],
        [0, 0, 0],
        [5, 0, 5],
        [0, 5, 5]
    ];

    test.each(testCases)(
        'should add %i and %i to get %i',
        (a: number, b: number, expected: number) => {
            expect(add(a, b)).toBe(expected);
        }
    );
});
```

Update `package.json` file with the following script:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "tsup",
    "test": "jest"
},
```

Run your test script with the following command:

```sh
npm run test
```

you should get the following SUCCESS output:

```sh
> goldbear-add@1.0.0 test
> jest

  console.log
    8

```

## create a github repo and add to it

download `gh` with `brew install gh`, then
login to gh if needed with `gh auth login`,
then run the following commands:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit, setting up project"
```

then,

### Option 1: if repo isn't present 

If repo isn't present at all create it with:

```sh
gh repo create goldbear-add --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

and you are done

### Option 2: if repo is present 

Alternatively, if it is already present you should add remote:

```sh
git remote add origin https://github.com/stangoldbear/goldbear-add.git
```

and push to it with:

```sh
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

and you are done
